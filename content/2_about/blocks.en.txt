They require nuance, fairness, and practical engagement. In contrast to prevailing discourses that portray Alawites as either a “ruling sect” or a “powerless minority,” TAP reopens this silenced story—not to justify or condemn, but to comprehend, enable, and strengthen."},{"question":"What are we doing?","answer":"On the ground, our enablement teams deliver humanitarian aid, support small businesses, and design programs that allow Alawite communities to thrive—while forging innovative bonds of interconnectedness. TAP operates at the crossroads of knowledge, creativity, and action, uniting pens, minds, and hands to create meaningful and lasting impact."},{"question":"How are we doing what we are doing?","answer":"Through rigorous research, creative expression, fieldwork, and grassroots engagement, TAP works to forge international and cross-sectarian alliances between Alawites and other communities. We create a platform for difficult questions, fruitful doubt, and collective learning. We write, document, volunteer, and dream—because understanding prevents the repetition of tragedy, action restores hope, and even a single idea can change the future."}],"card1title":"Our Approach","card1features":[{"icon":"arrowright","text":"Our work spans multiple dimensions.
